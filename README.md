# Network-Topology-Simulation-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
This project contains a basic-to-intermediate **network topology simulation** created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It is designed for academic purposes, showcasing how to build and simulate a structured network with routing, switching, and end-user devices.

## File Included

- `Project.pkt` â€“ The Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file

## Features

- Interconnected routers and switches
- End devices (PCs, printers, servers)
- Static or dynamic IP addressing (DHCP if configured)
- VLAN configuration (if applicable)
- Basic routing (RIP, OSPF, or static routes)
- PING and connectivity testing

## Requirements

- Cisco Packet Tracer 7.2 or newer
- Basic networking knowledge (IP addressing, subnetting, etc.)

## How to Run

1. Download and install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/portal/resources/packet-tracer).
2. Open the `Project.pkt` file inside Packet Tracer.
3. Explore the network structure and configurations.
4. Simulate network traffic using the simulation panel.
